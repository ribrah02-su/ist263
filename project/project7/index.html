        <h2>What is a Trinket?</h2>
        <p>A trinket is typically a small, decorative item collected for fun rather than for practical use. Some
            collectibles can also be considered trinkets, especially when they are small in size. Since most of the items
            I collect are tiny, I personally think of them as trinkets.</p>

        <h2>Examples of Trinkets and Collectibes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Coins</li>
            <li>Currency notes</li>
            <li>Antique and Vintage Toys</li>
            <li>Miniature or novelty Toys</li>
            <li>Shiny rocks and crystals</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why I began Collecting</h2>
        <p>I first got into collecting because I discovered <strong>Sonny Angels</strong> and thought they were adorable. I also loved
            the concept of <strong>blind boxes</strong>—the idea that you don’t know which figure you’ll get until you open it.
            There’s a fun element of surprise and chance: you might pull the exact one you were hoping for, or
            discover a new favorite. For me, the excitement of unboxing combined with the creativity and detail that
            goes into designing these little figures makes collecting really enjoyable.</p>
